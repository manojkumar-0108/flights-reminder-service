## üîç Exploring the `Folder Structure`

The `src` folder houses all the actual source code of the project, excluding any tests. It's organized into various subfolders to keep the codebase clean and maintainable. Let's take a look inside the `src` folder:

- ‚öôÔ∏è **`config`**: This folder contains configurations and setups for libraries or modules. For example:

  - **`server-config.js`**: Sets up `dotenv` for using environment variables in a cleaner fashion.

  - **`logger-config.js`**: Configuring a logging library for meaningful logs is also managed here.

  - **`config.json`**: Sets up `database` configuration, contains development, testing and production environment configuration such as
    - "username"
    - "password"
    - "database"
    - "host"
    - "dialect"

- üíº **`controllers`**: Acts as the intermediary between incoming requests and the business layer:

  - Receives incoming requests and data, then passes them to the business layer.
  - Structures API responses based on the business layer's output before sending them to the client.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **`errors`**: Contains custom error classes used across the project to handle exceptions.

- üîç **`middlewares`**: Intercepts incoming requests and allows for the implementation of:

  - Validators,
  - authenticators,
  - and other request interception logic.

- üõ†Ô∏è **`migrations`**: Houses database migration files to manage schema changes over time:

  - Creating new tables, altering existing tables, and adding indexes.

- üß© **`models`**: Contains JavaScript representations of database schemas.

- üóÉÔ∏è **`repositories`**: Provides logic for interacting with the database:

  - Houses all `raw` queries or `ORM` queries.

- üåê **`routes`**: Defines API routes for the application:

  - Registers routes with corresponding middlewares and controllers.

- üìù **`seeders`**: Populates the database with default values for roles, such as customer, flight_company, and admin.

- üîß **`services`**: Manages core application functionality and business logic, communicating with the repository layer for database interaction.

- üîß **`utils`**: Contains utility functions, helper methods, enums, and error handlers:
  - These functions provide common support to the rest of the application.

## Project Details

### üíæ Database Structure

The project uses a relational database to store data for various entities:

**DATABASE NAME** : `Flights_ReminderDB`

---

- **NotificationTickets** üîî: Stores notifications information such as subject, content, recepientEmail, etc.

  ```
      +-------------------------+
      |   NotificationTickets   |
      +-------------------------+
      |  id  -> (PK, Identity)  |
      |  subject                |
      |  content                |
      |  recepientEmail         |
      |  status   (Check Const) |
      |  notificationTime       |
      |  createdAt              |
      |  updatedAt              |
      +-------------------------+

      [status] values IN : ['pending','success','failed']

  ```

### üåê API Calls

The API endpoints use different `HTTP` methods(`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) and follow `RESTful` design principles.

The project provides a variety of API endpoints for different functionalities:

**Reminder Service BASE ADDRESS** : `http:localhost:5000/`

---

- **Notification Tickets**: Endpoints for creating a notification tickets.

  | HTTP Method | Endpoint            | Middleware                   | Controller            |
  | :---------- | :------------------ | :--------------------------- | :-------------------- |
  | GET         | `/api/tickets/ping` | `checkAuth`                  | `PingCheckController` |
  | POST        | `/api/tickets/`     | `validateCreateNotification` | `create`              |

---

### Subscribes to Message Queue

- The Flights Reminder Service subscribes to message queues from RabbitMQ to receive and handle notifications efficiently. The service establishes a connection with RabbitMQ and listens for messages published to specific queues. These messages can include reminders and notifications related to flight bookings and schedules.

- When a new message is received, the service processes the message by extracting the relevant information and taking appropriate action, such as sending an email or SMS reminder to the customer. This subscription to RabbitMQ queues allows the service to handle reminders asynchronously, ensuring that notifications are delivered in a timely and efficient manner.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

Error handling is a crucial aspect of the project, ensuring smooth operation and useful feedback for clients:

- **Custom Error Classes**: The project uses custom error classes like `BaseError`, `BadRequestError`, `InternalServerError`, and `AppError` to manage different types of errors and return appropriate HTTP status codes.

- **Middleware**: The `errorHandler` middleware function intercepts and handles exceptions by identifying the type of error and responding accordingly. It is executed just before express default error handler runs

- **Structured Responses**: Errors are structured as JSON objects with properties such as status code, message, and error explanation. This consistent response format simplifies troubleshooting for clients.

- **Default Handling**: If an unknown error occurs, the middleware throws a custom `InternalServerError` and log the error in `Logger`.

- **Logging**: All errors are logged for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes, enabling quick identification and resolution of problems.

The combination of these features ensures reliable and user-friendly error handling throughout the application.
